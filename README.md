# StarsMatch game

This is the StarsMatch game based from Samer Buna Pluralsight course [React: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started)
which has been ported to Typescript.

It's here to provide a reference and simple example on how to write a React game in typescript.
